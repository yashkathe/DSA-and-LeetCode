# Big O Notation

### Big O Notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms. It calculates the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows. In other words, it calculates the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm  
Now there are various ways to solve a single progamming problem.  
So to determine which one is the best approach we use the big O notation.  
Big O notation is way of generalising and comparing code and its performance with other code.
